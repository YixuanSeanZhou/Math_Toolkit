### Algebraic Tools

#### Euclidean Algorithm
`euclidean_algorithm.py`:
    Implemented the euclidean algorithm with the calculation of Bezout's coeffs and gcd.
    Output:
    ```python
    {
        'input': (a, b),
        'gcd': gcd,
        'BÃ©zout coefficients': (a's coeff, b's coeff),
        'quotients by the gcd:': (a's quotient, b's quotient)
    }
    ```
